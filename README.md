Decode-pelican
==============

Port of the [http://scotthsmith.com/projects/decode/](Decode) theme to [http://blog.getpelican.com/](Pelican) blog engine.

This is still work in progress theme. It requires Pelican version 3.0 or greater.

At the moment it does not have a sidebar, tag cloud and lacks social buttons. I have also removed Google Analitics and Disqus integration.
The last two was the conscious choice: I do not think such a secondary features should require JavaScript.

I am going to address the sidebar and social buttons issues first.
